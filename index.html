        <p>
            I am a full stack developer from the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York.  As of right now, I am still developing these skills which is more than likely evident by the quality of this page(and the lack of any backend).
            My main interests right now are music, cars, and computers.  As of right now the only instrument I can play is the guitar, but I have a keyboard I plan on practicing on.  I have been building computers since I was 12 years old
            and overclocking them for the same amount of time.
